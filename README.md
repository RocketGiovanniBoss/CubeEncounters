# CubeEncounters
CubeEncounters (v0.5) is a work-in-progress graphical editor for .csv wild encounter table files from the [Pok√©mon Disassembly Project (PRET) - pokeheartgold (https://github.com/pret/pokeheartgold).   It allows you to view, edit, and export encounter data for HeartGold/SoulSilver in an intuitive (I hope), tabbed interface.
